                <p>
                    I've built this little website with the hope of sharing my photos here.
                    This is a first draft. My vision is a blog with short posts accompanied
                    by some photos. As I upload more images I'll add a gallery of some sort
                    to view and filter them all. I would appreciate feedback, so please let
                    me know what you think.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, on to the photos!

                <p>
                    This is a photo shoot I did at an old abandoned auto body shop here
                    in Albuquerque. I noticed it on a drive in December &rsquo;23 and
                    made a note to go back and get some shots. Enjoy!

                    That's all I have for you in this initial post. I'll
                    work on uploading more of my photos in similar posts in the
                    near future.
